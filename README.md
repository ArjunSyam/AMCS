# AMCS
AMCS (Automated Marks Collection System) takes photo scanned images of the front mark sheets of test papers and correctly identifies all marks of the answer sheet inputing them digitally into a Excel sheet. This is an alternative to manually adding marks or universitys that do not have the resources to implement a full digital correction system.

The System comprises of two models - MSDM (MarkSheet Dectection Model) and HNGM (Handwritten Number Guessing Model)
Both Models are then combined and used the final AMCS ipynb file for full testing.
